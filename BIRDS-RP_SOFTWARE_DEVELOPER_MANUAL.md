This is a system where data arrives asynchronously and must be processed in real-time without losing bytes. 

It uses a mix of hardware register mappings and UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) configuration to handle communication and operations. 

This code sets up a hardware abstraction layer for:
- Timer 1 Configuration: Provides named access to specific bits in the T1CON register for controlling and configuring the Timer 1 peripheral.
- Data Communication: Configures a UART interface and declares variables and buffers for handling incoming and outgoing data.
  
It uses interrupts to receive data, buffers it, and provides functions to read from the buffer and process incoming data. 

Let's break it down line by line:

 
### STARTPIC_FUNCTIONS.C 

#### Hardware Register and Bit Definitions

``` c
#byte T1CON = 0x018
```
This line declares a byte (8-bit value) variable T1CON mapped to the hardware memory address 0x018. This address typically corresponds to the T1CON register in a microcontroller, which is used to control Timer 1. The register allows configuration of timer settings, such as prescaling, synchronization, and enabling the timer.


``` c
#bit    TMR1ON = T1CON.0
```
Declares TMR1ON as a bit within the T1CON register at bit position 0. TMR1ON is used to enable or disable Timer 1.


``` c
#bit    T1SYNC = T1CON.2
```
Maps T1SYNC to bit position 2 of the T1CON register. This bit controls the synchronization of Timer 1 with an external clock source.


``` c
#bit    T1OSCEN = T1CON.3
```
Maps T1OSCEN to bit position 3. This bit enables or disables the Timer 1 oscillator.


``` c
#bit    T1CKPS0 = T1CON.4
```
Maps T1CKPS0 to bit position 4. This bit is part of the prescaler configuration for Timer 1.


``` c
#bit    T1CKPS1 = T1CON.5
```
Maps T1CKPS1 to bit position 5. This works in combination with T1CKPS0 to set the prescaler value.


``` c
#bit    TMR1CS0 = T1CON.6
```
Maps TMR1CS0 to bit position 6. This bit is part of the configuration for the Timer 1 clock source.


``` c
#bit    TMR1CS1 = T1CON.7
```
Maps TMR1CS1 to bit position 7. Along with TMR1CS0, this sets the clock source for Timer 1.


#### Variable and Macro Definitions

``` c
unsigned int8 RPIC_TO_SPIC_ARRAY[10];
```
Declares an 8-bit unsigned integer array of size 10. This is used to store data being exchanged between two communication interfaces,  RPIC (Reset PIC) and SPIC (Start PIC).


```c
#define ON   0x69
#define OFF  0x96
```
Defines two macros: ON and OFF, with hexadecimal values 0x69 and 0x96. These represent status codes for controlling hardware.


``` c
char POWER_LINE_STATUS;
```
Declares a char variable to store the status of a power line,  representing whether the power is on or off.


#### UART Configuration and Buffer Variables

``` c
#define RP_BFR_SIZE 10
```
Defines the size of the RP_Buffer as 10 bytes,  for storing UART data


``` c
#use rs232(UART1, baud=38400, parity=N, bits=8, stream=RPIC, ERRORS)
```
Configures a UART communication interface:
- UART1: Uses UART1 hardware module.
- baud=38400: Sets the baud rate to 38,400 bits per second.
- parity=N: No parity bit is used.
- bits=8: 8 data bits per frame.
- stream=RPIC: Associates the UART stream with the name RPIC.
- ERRORS: Enables automatic handling of UART errors.


``` c
unsigned int8 RP_Buffer[RP_BFR_SIZE];
```
Declares an 8-bit unsigned integer array RP_Buffer of size RP_BFR_SIZE (10). This buffer stores incoming UART data.


``` c
unsigned int16 RP_Byte_Counter = 0;
```
Declares a 16-bit unsigned integer RP_Byte_Counter initialized to 0. It counts the number of bytes received or transmitted.


``` c
unsigned int8 RP_Overflow = 0;
```
Declares an 8-bit unsigned integer RP_Overflow initialized to 0. It indicates whether the RP_Buffer has overflowed.


``` c
unsigned int16 RP_Read_Byte_counter = 0;
```
Declares a 16-bit unsigned integer RP_Read_Byte_counter initialized to 0. It tracks the number of bytes read from the RP_Buffer.


``` c
unsigned int8 RP_Temp_byte = 0;
```
Declares an 8-bit unsigned integer RP_Temp_byte initialized to 0. This is a temporary variable for storing a single byte during processing.


#### Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) for UART

ISR (```SERIAL_ISR1()```): Handles incoming UART data efficiently, storing it in a buffer.

``` c
#INT_RDA
Void SERIAL_ISR1() // MAIN PIC UART interrupt loop
{
   if( RP_Byte_Counter < RP_BFR_SIZE )
   {
      RP_Buffer[RP_Byte_Counter] = fgetc(RPIC);
      RP_Byte_Counter++;
   }
   else RP_Overflow = fgetc(RPIC);
}
```

```INT_RDA```: This is the interrupt identifier for UART receive data available. It triggers whenever the UART hardware receives a byte.

```SERIAL_ISR1()```: The interrupt handler (ISR) for the UART.

Operation:
- If the buffer (```RP_Buffer```) has space:
The received byte is read from the UART (```fgetc(RPIC)```) and stored in the buffer at the current position (```RP_Byte_Counter```).
The byte counter (```RP_Byte_Counter```) increments.
- If the buffer is full:
The received byte is discarded by reading it (```fgetc(RPIC)```), and the overflow flag (```RP_Overflow```) is set. This prevents the UART hardware from getting stuck.

#### Function to Check Available Bytes

``` c
RPic_Available()
```
Checks buffer status.

``` c
unsigned int8 RPic_Available()
{
   return RP_Byte_Counter;
}
```
This function checks if there is data available to read from the buffer and returns the number of bytes currently in the buffer (```RP_Byte_Counter```).

#### Function to Read a Byte

``` c
RPic_Read()
```
Safely reads from the buffer, maintaining counters and avoiding overflow.

``` c
unsigned int8 RPic_Read()
{
   if (RP_Byte_Counter > 0)
   {    
      RP_Temp_byte = RP_Buffer[RP_Read_Byte_counter];
      RP_Byte_Counter--;
      RP_Read_Byte_counter++;
      if(RP_Byte_Counter == 0) RP_Read_Byte_counter = 0;
      return RP_Temp_byte; 
   }
   if (RP_Byte_Counter == 0)
   { 
      RP_Read_Byte_counter = 0;
      RP_Temp_byte = 0x00;
      return RP_Temp_byte; 
   }
}
```
1. Checks if there are bytes available (```RP_Byte_Counter > 0```):
- Reads the byte from RP_Buffer at the position of RP_Read_Byte_counter.
- Decreases the byte counter(```RP_Byte_Counter```) and increments the read index (```RP_Read_Byte_counter```).
- If the buffer is now empty (```RP_Byte_Counter == 0```), resets the read index (```RP_Read_Byte_counter = 0```).
2. If no data is available:
- Resets the read index and returns 0x00 as a default.

#### Function to Process Incoming UART Data

``` c
CHECK_UART_INCOMING_FROM_RESET_PIC()
```
Processes incoming messages, searches for a synchronization byte (0xAA), and stores the message in an array. It also sends part of the data to a PC for debugging or monitoring.

``` c
void CHECK_UART_INCOMING_FROM_RESET_PIC()
{
   if( Rpic_Available() )
   {
      delay_ms(10);
      for(int i=0; i<8; i++)
      {
         if( RPIC_Read() == 0xAA )
         {
            RPIC_TO_SPIC_ARRAY[0] = 0xAA;
            break;
         }
      }
      for(int i=1; i<10; i++)
      {
         RPIC_TO_SPIC_ARRAY[i] = RPIC_Read();
      }
      for(int i=0; i<3; i++)
      {
         fprintf(PC, "%X ", RPIC_TO_SPIC_ARRAY[i]);
      }
      fprintf(PC, "\n\r");
   }
}
```
1.Checks if data is available:
- Calls ```Rpic_Available()``` to see if the buffer has any bytes.
2. Waits briefly:
  - Introduces a 10 ms delay (```delay_ms(10)```). This might allow more data to arrive if the system is processing a multi-byte message.
3. Searches for a synchronization byte (```0xAA```):
- Loops up to 8 times, reading bytes using ```RPIC_Read()```.
- If it finds ```0xAA```, it stores it in the first position of the ```RPIC_TO_SPIC_ARRAY``` array and exits the loop.
4. Reads remaining data:
- Fills the rest of the ```RPIC_TO_SPIC_ARRAY``` array with the next 9 bytes from the buffer.
5. Prints the first three bytes to the PC:
- Sends the first three bytes from ```RPIC_TO_SPIC_ARRAY``` to a PC via another UART (```fprintf(PC, "%X ", ...)```).
- Ends the output with a newline and carriage return.

#### Initial power management
The next code defines three utility functions for managing power lines and clearing a communication array. These functions manage the power lines by controlling GPIO pins. A "low" state turns off the power, while a "high" state turns it on. Delays ensure stable transitions. Clearing the ```RPIC_TO_SPIC_ARRAY``` is essential for ensuring the integrity of data in UART-based communication. The ```POWER_LINE_STATUS``` variable is used to track whether power lines are on (ON) or off (OFF), which can be helpful for debugging or program logic.

**TURN_OFF_ALL_POWER_LINES()**
This function disables power to all connected components by setting specific control pins to a "low" state (0V).

``` c
void TURN_OFF_ALL_POWER_LINES()
{
   output_Low(PIN_D6); // Switch enable for COM PIC
   output_Low(PIN_D7); // Switch enable for Main PIC   
   output_Low(PIN_C2); // OCP switch disable for Unreg #1
   output_Low(PIN_C5); // OCP switch disable for Unreg #2
   
   POWER_LINE_STATUS = OFF;
   fprintf(PC, "Turned OFF Power lines\n\r");
}
```

- ```output_Low(PIN_D6)```; Sets the voltage of PIN_D6 to low, disabling the power line for the COM PIC.
- ```output_Low(PIN_D7)```; Sets the voltage of PIN_D7 to low, disabling the power line for the Main PIC.
- ```output_Low(PIN_C2)```; Disables the Over-Current Protection (OCP) switch for an unregulated power line labeled "Unreg #1".
- ```output_Low(PIN_C5)```; Disables the OCP switch for "Unreg #2".
- ```POWER_LINE_STATUS = OFF```; Updates the ```POWER_LINE_STATUS``` variable to the predefined constant OFF (0x96).
- ```fprintf(PC, "Turned OFF Power lines\n\r")```; Sends a message over a serial connection (to a PC or debugging terminal) to confirm the action.


**TURN_ON_ALL_POWER_LINES()**
This function enables power to all connected components by setting specific control pins to a "high" state (e.g., 3.3V or 5V).

``` c
void TURN_ON_ALL_POWER_LINES()
{
   output_High(PIN_D6);                                                         
   Delay_ms(50);
   output_High(PIN_D7);                                                         
   Delay_ms(50);
   output_High(PIN_C2);                                                         
   Delay_ms(50);
   output_High(PIN_C5);                                                         
   Delay_ms(50);
   
   POWER_LINE_STATUS = ON;
   fprintf(PC, "Turned ON Power lines\n\r");
}
```

- ```output_High(PIN_D6)```; Sets the voltage of PIN_D6 to high, enabling the power line for the COM PIC.
- ```Delay_ms(50)```; Waits for 50 milliseconds to stabilize the power line.
- ```output_High(PIN_D7)```; Enables the power line for the Main PIC. Another 50 ms delay is added for stability.
- ```output_High(PIN_C2)```; and ```output_High(PIN_C5)```;
Enables the OCP switches for the unregulated power lines "Unreg #1" and "Unreg #2," with 50 ms delays in between.
- ```POWER_LINE_STATUS = ON```; Updates the POWER_LINE_STATUS variable to the predefined constant ON (likely 0x69).
- ```fprintf(PC, "Turned ON Power lines\n\r")```; Sends a confirmation message to a PC or debugging terminal.

**CLEAR_RPIC_TO_SPIC_ARRAY()**
This function resets the ```RPIC_TO_SPIC_ARRAY``` to all zeros. This is used to clear stale or invalid data from the communication array.

``` c
void CLEAR_RPIC_TO_SPIC_ARRAY()
{
   for( int i = 0; i<10; i++ ) RPIC_TO_SPIC_ARRAY[i] = 0;
}
```

- ```for( int i = 0; i<10; i++ )```: Iterates through the 10 elements of the ```RPIC_TO_SPIC_ARRAY```.
- ```RPIC_TO_SPIC_ARRAY[i] = 0```: Sets each element of the array to 0, effectively clearing it.


### STARTPIC.C

This is the main code for the Start PIC MCU that manages power lines and checks for responses from another microcontroller (Reset PIC).

#### Headers and Configuration

``` c
#include <16F1789.h>
```
Includes the device-specific header file for the PIC16F1789 microcontroller. This provides access to hardware-specific definitions like registers, pins, and peripherals.

``` c
#fuses NOWDT, MCLR, NOBROWNOUT
```
- NOWDT: Disables the Watchdog Timer (WDT).
- MCLR: Enables the Master Clear Reset pin for manual reset.
- NOBROWNOUT: Disables the Brown-Out Reset feature, which would reset the MCU if the supply voltage drops below a threshold.


``` c
#use delay(Crystal = 16MHz, clock = 16MHz)
```
Specifies that the system uses a 16 MHz crystal oscillator.

``` c
#use rs232(baud=38400, parity=N, xmit=PIN_D3, bits=8, stream=PC, force_sw)
```
Configures a UART communication stream on PIN_D3 for transmitting data at 38,400 baud. The force_sw option enforces software-based serial communication.


**Global Variables**

``` c
unsigned int16 RPIC_RESPOND_SEC_COUNTER = 0;
unsigned int16 MLC = 0;

unsigned int16 SEC_COUNT = 0;
unsigned int8 ONEHOUR_FLAG = 0x00;
```

- ```RPIC_RESPOND_SEC_COUNTER```: Tracks how long the Reset PIC takes to respond.
- ```MLC```: A secondary counter used in the main loop.
- ```SEC_COUNT```: A timer counter incrementing every 100 ms to track one-hour periods.
- ```ONEHOUR_FLAG```: A flag indicating whether one hour has elapsed. 0xAA means one hour has passed.

``` c
char BB, CC;
```
Temporary variables to read inputs from pins.


#### Main Function
The main function manages the system by checking for responses from the Reset PIC, turning power lines ON/OFF based on conditions and handling a 1-hour timer and ensuring the system doesn't stall.

*Key Tasks:*
- Use UART communication to interact with another microcontroller.
- Track time for system stability and response.
- Control power lines for external components.
- Manage external Watchdog Timer toggling.

**Initialization**

``` c
void main()
{
   Delay_ms(500);
   fprintf(PC, "Start PIC booting...........\n\r");
```
- Delays startup by 500 ms to allow system stabilization.
- Sends a message over the UART (serial) indicating that the Start PIC is booting.

``` c
enable_interrupts(INT_RDA);
enable_interrupts(GLOBAL);
```
- Enables the Receive Data Available (RDA) interrupt for UART communication.
- Enables global interrupts for the system.

``` c
   TURN_ON_ALL_POWER_LINES();
```
Powers on all connected components by calling the function ```TURN_ON_ALL_POWER_LINES```.

``` c
   CC = input(PIN_B6);
   BB = input(PIN_B7);
```
Reads the digital state of pins PIN_B6 and PIN_B7 into variables CC and BB.

Let us delve further into the main loop itself to see how it works.
**Main Loop**
``` c
   while(TRUE)
   {
      CHECK_UART_INCOMING_FROM_RESET_PIC();
```

- Infinite Loop: Continuously executes system tasks.
- ```CHECK_UART_INCOMING_FROM_RESET_PIC```: Checks for data from the Reset PIC and processes it.

``` c
      if( ONEHOUR_FLAG == 0xAA )
      {
         if( (RPIC_TO_SPIC_ARRAY[0] == 0xAA) && (RPIC_TO_SPIC_ARRAY[1] == 0xBB) && (RPIC_TO_SPIC_ARRAY[2] == 0xCC) )
         {
            RPIC_RESPOND_SEC_COUNTER = 0;
            MLC = 0;
            if( POWER_LINE_STATUS == ON ) TURN_OFF_ALL_POWER_LINES();
            CLEAR_RPIC_TO_SPIC_ARRAY();
         }
```

- Checks if one hour has passed (```ONEHOUR_FLAG == 0xAA```).
- If the Reset PIC has sent a valid response (RPIC_TO_SPIC_ARRAY[0..2] match expected values), it:
  - Resets the response counter.
  - Turns off power lines if they are ON.
  - Clears the response buffer.

``` c
         if( MLC >= 50 )
         {
            MLC = 0;
            RPIC_RESPOND_SEC_COUNTER++;
         }
```
If MLC reaches 50 iterations, increment the response counter.

``` c
         if( RPIC_RESPOND_SEC_COUNTER >= 36 )
         {
            fprintf(PC, "Reset pic did not respond for three minute\n\r");
            RPIC_RESPOND_SEC_COUNTER = 0;
            TURN_ON_ALL_POWER_LINES();
         }
```
If no valid response from the Reset PIC after 3 minutes (36 counts), log a message and turn the power lines back on.

***Hourly Timer***

``` c
      if( ONEHOUR_FLAG == 0x00 )
      {
         SEC_COUNT++;
         if(SEC_COUNT >= 36000)     // one hour 36000
         {
            ONEHOUR_FLAG = 0xAA;
         }
      }
```

- If one hour hasn't passed (```ONEHOUR_FLAG == 0x00```), increment ```SEC_COUNT``` every 100 ms.
- Once ```SEC_COUNT``` reaches 36,000 (1 hour), set ```ONEHOUR_FLAG``` to ```0xAA```.

**Watchdog Toggle**
``` c
      delay_ms(100);
      Output_Toggle(PIN_B2);
```
- Delays 100 ms in each iteration.
- Toggles the state of PIN_B2 to reset an external Watchdog Timer.

###  ADC_Power_Lines_Control.c 

This code manages power lines, resets the system, and monitors current and voltage using analog-to-digital converter (ADC). Each function is modular and updates ```POWER_LINE_STATUS``` to track the state of the system. Functions like ```SYSTEM_RESET``` and ```SYSTEM_RESET_24H``` ensure operational stability through scheduled or manual resets.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the functionality:

#### Global Definitions and Variables

``` c
#define ON  1
#define OFF 0
```
Defines symbolic constants ```ON``` and ```OFF``` for readability, representing ```1``` (ON) and ```0``` (OFF) states.

``` c
#define BB_ON_OCP_ON   1
#define BB_ON_OCP_OFF  2
#define BB_OFF_OCP_OFF 3
```
Defines states for a buck-boost converter and overcurrent protection (OCP):
- ```BB_ON_OCP_ON```: Buck-boost ON, OCP ON.
- ```BB_ON_OCP_OFF```: Buck-boost ON, OCP OFF.
- ```BB_OFF_OCP_OFF```: Buck-boost OFF, OCP OFF.

``` c
unsigned int8 POWER_LINE_STATUS = 0;
unsigned int8 RESET_TIME = 0;
```
- ```POWER_LINE_STATUS```: 8-bit variable where each bit indicates the status of different power lines or components.
- ```RESET_TIME```: Tracks the time when a system reset occurred.

#### Functions for System Components

MP_CP_BuckBoost(): This function controls the Main PIC <-> Com PIC buck-boost converter.

``` c
void MP_CP_BuckBoost(int1 status)
{
    if (status == ON)
    {
      output_LOW(PIN_C4);
    }
    if (status == OFF)
    {
      output_HIGH(PIN_C4);
    }
    RST_EXT_WDT();
}
```
- Turns the converter ON/OFF by controlling ```PIN_C4```.
- Calls ```RST_EXT_WDT()``` to reset an external watchdog timer (prevents system reset due to inactivity).

MainPic_Power(): This function manages power for the main microcontroller (Main PIC)

``` c
void MainPic_Power(int1 status)
{
    if (status == 1)
    {
       output_high(PIN_F5);
       BIT_SET(POWER_LINE_STATUS,7);
    }
    if (status == 0)
    {
       output_low(PIN_F5);
       BIT_CLEAR(POWER_LINE_STATUS,7);
    }
    delay_ms(50);
    RST_EXT_WDT();
}
```

       BIT_CLEAR(POWER_LINE_STATUS,6);
    }
    delay_ms(50);
    RST_EXT_WDT();

``` c
void SYSTEM_RESET()
{  
   int sec_c = 0;
   Fprintf(PC,"system reset by command \n\r");
   // turn off system
   MainPic_Power(OFF)                ;  Delay_ms(250) ; 
   ComPic_Power(OFF);Delay_ms(250)   ;  Delay_ms(250) ; 
   _3V3Power_Line1(BB_OFF_OCP_OFF)   ;  Delay_ms(250) ; 
   _3V3Power_Line2(BB_OFF_OCP_OFF)   ;  Delay_ms(250) ; 
   _5V0Power_Line(BB_OFF_OCP_OFF)    ;  Delay_ms(250) ; 
   Unreg1_Line(OFF);Delay_ms(250)    ;  Delay_ms(250) ; 
   Unreg2_Line(OFF);Delay_ms(250)    ;  Delay_ms(250) ;

   RESET_TIME = hour;

   for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
   {
       Delay_ms(500);
       RST_EXT_WDT();
       Delay_ms(500);

       sec_c++;
       Fprintf(PC, "Waiting to turn on system again %02d Sec\n\r", sec_c);
   }

   // turn on system
   MainPic_Power(ON)                ;    Delay_ms(250) ;      
   ComPic_Power(ON)                 ;    Delay_ms(250) ;

}
```
- Sequentially turns off all components.
- Set reset time to 1 hour
- Waits 10 seconds, resetting the watchdog timer periodically (every  half second).
- Turns all components back on after the delay.

SYSTEM_RESET_24H(): This function automates a daily reset at a specific time. Similar to SYSTEM_RESET(), but triggered when hour, minute, and second match predefined values.

#### ADC Measurement Functions

Each power rail or unregulated line has a sensor (e.g., a current sensor or voltage divider) connected to the analog input of the microcontroller. The microcontroller reads these analog signals and converts them into digital values using its ADC module.

The ADC readings are stored in the corresponding variables (```_Raw_power_ADC_val```, ```_3V3_1_current_ADC_val```, etc.) for further processing or monitoring.

These values are used for:
- Power system diagnostics (e.g., detecting overcurrent conditions).
- Monitoring power health in real-time.
- Logging and telemetry 

**Commented Section**

The commented code below describes how certain hardware signals are being monitored and measured using analog-to-digital conversion.

``` c
// C3 = Raw power monitor enable
// A2 (AN2) = Raw voltage measure
// A1 (AN1) = 3V3-1 current measure
// A0 (AN0) = 3V3-2 current measure
// A5 (AN4) = 5V0 current measure
// A4 (AN6) = UNREG-1 current measure
// C2 (AN9) = UNREG-2 current measure
```

Each signal is mapped to a specific pin (or port) on the microcontroller, and the purpose of that pin is described:

1. ```C3 = Raw power monitor enable```
- This pin (```C3```) controls a pin used to enable or disable monitoring of the raw power input. It is toggled as needed to save power and/or isolate specific circuits.
2. ```A2 (AN2) = Raw voltage measure```
- Analog channel 2 (```AN2```) is used to measure the raw voltage level. This represents the voltage coming directly from the power source before regulation.
3. ```A1 (AN1) = 3V3-1 current measure```
- Analog channel 1 (```AN1```) measures the current flowing through the 3.3V#1 power rail (```3V3-1```).
4. ```A0 (AN0) = 3V3-2 current measure```
- Analog channel 0 (```AN0```) measures the current flowing through the 3.3V#2 power rail (```3V3-2```).
5. ```A5 (AN4) = 5V0 current measure```
- Analog channel 4 (```AN4```) measures the current on the 5V power line.
6. ```A4 (AN6) = UNREG-1 current measure```
- Analog channel 6 (```AN6```) measures the current for an unregulated power line labeled UNREG-1.
7. ```C2 (AN9) = UNREG-2 current measure```
- Analog channel 9 (```AN9```) measures the current for another unregulated power line labeled UNREG-2.

``` c
unsigned int16 _Raw_power_ADC_val       = 0 ;          
unsigned int16 _3V3_1_current_ADC_val   = 0 ;          
unsigned int16 _3V3_2_current_ADC_val   = 0 ;          
unsigned int16 _5V0_current_ADC_val     = 0 ;          
unsigned int16 _UNREG_1_current_ADC_val = 0 ;      
unsigned int16 _UNREG_2_current_ADC_val = 0 ;
```

**Variables**

The variables declared are used to store the ADC (Analog-to-Digital Conversion) readings for the respective signals.

- ```unsigned int16 _Raw_power_ADC_val = 0```; Holds the ADC result for the raw power voltage measurement (from AN2).
- ```unsigned int16 _3V3_1_current_ADC_val = 0```; Stores the ADC result for the current measurement of 3V3-1 (from AN1).
- ```unsigned int16 _3V3_2_current_ADC_val = 0```; Stores the ADC result for the current measurement of 3V3-2 (from AN0).
- ```unsigned int16 _5V0_current_ADC_val = 0```; Holds the ADC result for the current measurement of the 5V power line (from AN4).
- ```unsigned int16 _UNREG_1_current_ADC_val = 0```; Stores the ADC result for the current measurement of the unregulated power line UNREG-1 (from AN6).
- ```unsigned int16 _UNREG_2_current_ADC_val = 0```; Stores the ADC result for the current measurement of the unregulated power line UNREG-2 (from AN9).



Measure_*(): This function measures voltages and currents for different lines

``` c
unsigned int16 Measure_Raw_voltage() {
    Output_low(PIN_C3);
    Delay_us(100);
    SET_ADC_CHANNEL(2);
    delay_us(20);
    Output_high(PIN_C3);
    return READ_ADC();
}
```
Activates an ADC pin, sets the channel, and reads the voltage or current.
